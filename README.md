# car-parking-detection
The Car Parking Space Detection project is a practical application of computer vision and image processing techniques designed to simplify the management and monitoring of parking spaces. Inspired by Murtaza's Computer Vision Zone course, this project offers a robust solution for tracking parking space occupancy in real-time.
